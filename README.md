Copy HTML Template into DOM

## Install the Polymer-CLI

There are a number of scenarios where a snippet of HTML must be copied (repeatedly) into the DOM tree.  This is what the Template Element [was designed for:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template)

>  Think of a template as a content fragment that is being stored for subsequent use in the document. While the parser does process the contents of the \<template\> element while loading the page, it does so only to ensure that those contents are valid; the element's contents are not rendered, however.

Out of the box, the template must be imported programmatically.  This can disrupt the flow when a document is primarly markup driven.

The carbon copy element (c-c) for short, allows one to declaratively copy
